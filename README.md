# Password_Generator

This project uses javascript to create an app that randomly generates a password from the user's input choice.

##How I Did It:

1. Lines 6-9: Created arrays needed for all possible characters included in the final password.

2. Line 13: Empty array created to push all arrays picked from the users choice from confirms.

3. Line 17: Empty array that will contain the final characters that were randomly selected from the finalPassword array to create the randomly generated password.

4. Line 34: Function created to begin collecting all the info needed, and putting the password together.

5. Line 38: Prompt to gather an input from the user on the number of characters that the password will contain.
